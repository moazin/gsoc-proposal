### Projects Completed

- **Odd Jobs**: An android app that connects workers with consumers in realtime. Frontend was in Java and backend was in NodeJS.
- **Messenger**: Built a messenger using NodeJS. PostreSQL and MongoDB were used to save data. 
- **2D Mapping using LIDAR** : A lidar and microcontroller programmed in C++ was used to detect distance and the data was sent to a PC using serialport. A Webpage then draws a 2D map of that space. I wrote mapping library myself. Frontend was in Vanilla Javascript.
- **Event Websites** : Developed event websites for university. More than 2000 users have registered using these websites.

### Opensource Projects
- Math Trade with Trade Maximizer, currently implemented using Couchbase. This ensures maximum possible trades between people. Both API and a simple frontend is available on github.
- HSM, this project's main purpose is to write encryption and hashing algorithms that can run on small microcontrollers
- [Feat: Added XML support to Graphiql](https://github.com/graphql/graphiql/pull/1430)

### Test Project

I have created both server and client. They are deployed on AWS. This is a basic app. API provides information of patients, hospitals and statistics. New patients and hospitals can be added using mutations. Links are given here.
